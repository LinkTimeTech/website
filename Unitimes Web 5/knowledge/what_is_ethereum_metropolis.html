                                        good reason. The last time Ethereum did a network shift i.e. from Frontier to
                                        Homestead, the price jumped more than 100% from $12 to $30.

                                        of course and it won’t be the last time. Ethereum was not designed to be just a
                                        mode of currency. It was designed to be a platform for decentralized
                                        applications. However, before it can do so, it needs to go through various
                                        stages of growth. With each stage, Ethereum “levels up” by incorporating more
                                        and more properties making its system more robust and seamless.

                                        divided into 4 stages. This was done to make sure that various phases got their
                                        own developmental time and that every stage was developed as efficiently and
                                        optimally as possible.

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For those who don’t know, Sudoku is a Japanese
                                        puzzle where you get a 9X9 table which looks something like this:

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea is to fill up every row, every column
                                        and every 3X3 block with numbers from 1-9 and no number should repeat itself.
                                        So, the solution for the puzzle above looks like this:
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you can see, every row, column, and 3X3
                                        block is unique and not a single number has been repeated. Let’s go back to our
                                        old friends Anna and Carl. Anna has found the solution to the Sudoku puzzle and
                                        Carl, skeptic that he is, doesn’t believe her and wants Anna to prove that she
                                        does indeed know the solution. Anna wants to prove her honesty, but at the same
                                        time, she doesn’t want Carl to know the exact solution of the puzzle. How will
                                        she go about it? Anna is going to use Zero Knowledge to prove the validity of
                                        her claim.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, Carl will run the Sudoku solution
                                        through a computer program which has been verified, to be honest, and the
                                        program will run the numbers through a randomly chosen substitution cipher. Say,
                                        for this particular problem the cipher that the program has chosen is this:
                                    </p>
                                    <img class="graf--p graf-image" src="../images/knowledge/e1.png" width="100%">
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The chosen program and cipher is such that
                                        each digit has the same chance of being transmuted into its substitution as any
                                        other number. Basically, 1 has as much chance of being transmuted as 3 and 4 has
                                        as much chance of being transmuted as 9 and so on and so forth. So, using this
                                        cipher gives us the following solution to the puzzle above:
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anna gets the transmuted solution now, keep in
                                        mind that Carl still doesn’t know what the original solution was and he doesn’t
                                        possess the transmuted solution either. So, what Anna does now is that she hides
                                        all the numbers in the puzzle by using a “lockbox mechanism”, basically Carl
                                        won’t be able to see any of the numbers and will see an empty 9X9 grid in front
                                        of him.

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what he will see. Carl will see that

                                        Carl will have no clue as to what the original solution is.

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now suppose, Carl decides to take the last

                                        will have no idea what the original solution is. Carl can now go through all 28
                                        of his choices and eventually he will be satisfied with the validity of Anna’s

                                        Carl’s choices. If Carl just chooses one option, Anna’s chances of getting away
                                        with cheating are 27/28. BUT if Carl chose to do random test multiple times,
                                        suppose he chooses to test it 150 times, Anna’s choice of getting away with

                                        is immense. To understand its application, it is important to know how a smart
                                        contract works. A smart contract is basically an escrow of funds which gets
                                        activated once a particular function is done.

                                        going to generate the proof using the proving algorithm P. She is going to prove
                                        that she knows the secret value “w” which hashes (on parsing through SHA-256) to

                                        bitcoin. When bitcoin was first introduced, mining was extremely simple and
                                        anybody could do it using their PC. However, as bitcoin got more and more
                                        popular the number of miners on the network increased. This raised a very real
                                        possibility of miners going out of control and mining out all the remaining
                                        bitcoins in the space of a year. Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned this happening and
                                        hence introduced the “difficulty” system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The difficulty system works like this: Miners
                                        spend their computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles. The way they do
                                        that is that they randomly append a random string (called nonce) to the hash of
                                        the block and then they hash the whole string. If the resulting number is less
                                        than a particular fixed number, then it is considered to be successful and the
                                        new block is added to the blockchain.  Finding this “nonce” is extremely
                                        difficult and random and that is the heart of all mining.

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Smart contracts are how things get done on
                                        ethereum. The idea is simple. Imagine A and B getting a transaction or a
                                        function done without the intervention of a third party. Suppose A tells B to do
                                        a task for which B charges 1 ETH. A puts that 1 ETH in a “box”. If B does the
                                        task then that 1 ETH goes to B, if he doesn’t then that 1 ETH goes back to A.
                                        The “box” in this analogy is a smart contract. This is a rough analogy to help
                                        you understand how it works.

                                        money required to pay up for this gas is called “ether”. The gas price chart

                                        computational power for all transactions, Ethereum can vary the computational
                                        power required for each of its contracts. Each contract has its own gas limit
                                        which is set by the contract giver. This can lead to two scenarios:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• The gas required is more than the limit set.
                                        If that’s the case then the state of contract is reverted back to its original
                                        state and all the gas is used up.
                                    </p>

                                        If that’s the case, then the contract is completed and the leftover gas is given
                                        over to the contract setter.
                                    </p>

                                        go back to an earlier state during the execution, it would require manual
                                        triggering of an exception eg. if one were to cancel a transaction then they
                                        will have to double spend to stop it from going through. In order to revert a
                                        contract back to its original state developers use the “throw” function.  While
                                        the throw function does help the contract’s state to go back to the previous
                                        one, it eats up all the gas in the contract.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To counter this problem, Metropolis is beefing
                                        up the “revert” function to help the contracts go back to the previous state
                                        without eating up all the gas. The unused gas will be refunded to the contract
                                        creator. Along with the revert function, Metropolis is introducing the
                                        “returndata” opcode which will enable contracts to return variable sized values.

                                        means, let’s understand what abstraction means. Abstraction means that anyone
                                        can use any system or protocol without completely knowing the ins and outs and
                                        all the technical details. Eg. When you use your iPhone, you don’t need to be a
                                        programmer or an engineer to operate it. You simply press on the screen to
                                        activate an app, or press on the call button to call someone. You don’t need to
                                        know how pressing certain apps activates the circuit inside the phone or how
                                        certain apps were programmed. Abstraction makes a complex technology accessible
                                        to the masses by removing the complexities.

                                        in the future. In a hypothetical decentralized future, they envision everyone to
                                        use DAPPS without even realizing that they using a DAPP based on Ethereum. They
                                        basically want Ethereum to “disappear” in the background. Metropolis is taking a
                                        major step towards doing just that by introducing “Account Abstraction”.

                                        to blur the line between its two accounts. Ethereum, as of writing at least, has
                                        two accounts.  One is the external account, the one controlled by keys that most
                                        users are aware of i.e. wallet accounts. Then you also have the contract account
                                        aka the smart contract code in the blockchain. The idea is to essentially allow
                                        users to define their external accounts in the form of a smart contract.

                                        can put their own unique spin on the transactions backing the code. How does
                                        that help? As you may be aware that Quantum computing is fast becoming a
                                        possible threat to the cryptography which makes the cryptocurrencies. So suppose
                                        you want to save your transactions from a quantum attack by a malicious
                                        attacker, what can you do about it?

                                        signature schemes like hash ladders to define your own account which has a

                                        there be a third ethereum coin?
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, there won’t be.

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of the Ethereum-Ethereum Classic and
                                        the Bitcoin-Bitcoin Cash hardforks, people have started to assume that all hard
                                        forks are bound to cause chain splits. That is simply not the case.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason why those forks split the chain was
                                        because the changes proposed (the ethereum hardfork and the Segwit activation)
                                        were so controversial that not everyone was on board.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, these upgrades have been unanimously
                                        agreed upon for a long time. Everybody knew that this was going to happen. This
                                        hardfork is not the result of an emergency, this hardfork is the result of an
                                        upgrade, which is why there won’t be any community split and there won’t be a
                                        new coin.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only bone of contention could be the
                                        proof-of-stake hardfork, however, the miners are not going to gain much by
                                        remaining on the old chain since, as already discussed, the difficulty bomb will
                                        make mining near impossible.

                                        You need to do your own research before you invest in a coin. However, what we
                                        can say for sure is that they last time ethereum upgraded, the value went up
