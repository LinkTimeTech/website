                                    <p> Founder of Ethereum, the world’s second-most valuable cryptocurrency network
                                        behind Bitcoin
                                    </p>
                                    <p> We are honored to interview this “boy genius” founder of Ethereum, Vitalik
                                        Buterin, and introduce his life story with our audience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> From the beginning of the 2011, Vitalik first heard about the bitcoin from his
                                        father. It was also the time when Bitcoin got people’s attention for the first
                                        time. In order to further explore the ‘Bitcoin’, Vitalik immediately went onto
                                        the bitcoin forums, and found someone who was willing to pay him 5 BTC (then 4
                                        USD) per article on the forums. He therefore gained his first 20 BTC, and
                                        started his first life career with Bitcoin Magazine as a blog author (Blog Link:
                                        <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/vitalik-buterin/">
                                            https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/vitalik-buterin/</a>)
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Gradually, Vitalik found his interests in the Blockchain. He explained that “I
                                        was excited by the idea that a community of a few thousand people just like
                                        myself with computers just like my own could independently create an entire new
                                        financial system from the scratch, without relying on any existing institutions
                                        or intermediaries.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p> In 2013, Vitalik went to the University of Waterloo, but he still took almost
                                        the full-time working for his bitcoin project, like what he said: “I realized
                                        that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something interesting。”
                                        Interests create the miracles. By noticing the life-long interests, he decided
                                        to devote his full efforts to the industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Like Steve Jobs, the founder of the Apple, Vitalik decided to take a term off
                                        from the University and spent all of his time traveling around the world.
                                        Working on the project, while interacting with other people in the industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> After four months of travelling, Vitalik met several teams working on the
                                        next-generation applications through the Blockchain technology in Israel, going
                                        beyond the bitcoin. He soon realized that the direction they analyzed at the
                                        time was appealing, but the projects were not sufficiently powerful for the job.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> “The common approach at the time was to create a protocol that would have
                                        several transaction types, with one or two transaction types for each
                                        application. I came up with the more generalized approach of creating a
                                        Blockchain with a general-purpose built-in programming language.” Vitalik said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Therefore, based on his ideas, Vitalik established his first Non-for-Profit
                                        Organization, “<a
                                                href="http://www.linktimetech.com/%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%9D%8A%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6-Ethereum.pdf">Ethereum</a>”,
                                        and wrote the white paper for the organization. He emailed his paper to several
                                        friends, and those friends sent over to their friends. After a month, the
                                        initial Ethereum team was formulized.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> As the Ethereum was first heard by the world, it works as the world’s
                                        second-most valuable cryptocurrency network behind the Bitcoin, with numerous
                                        attention and interests. When we asked why did he set Ethereum as the form of
                                        the Non-for- Profit organization instead of the for-profit organization, he
                                        said:
                                    </p>
                                    <p> “I thought it was important that the Ethereum was a neutral project created for
                                        the benefit of the whole world that would not be owned or built to enrich a
                                        small group of people.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Also, when he answered the question of the changes of the Ethereum, if he can
                                        start all over again, he said:
                                    </p>
                                    <p> “I would change some technical details, like making the protocol more
                                        parallelization-friendly from the start, and I would change how I created and
                                        managed the team from the start but otherwise I would not have changed the core
                                        vision.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p> As he stated the core values that he put in the Ethereum: to benefit the whole
                                        world and to make the world a better place, Ethereum will become a brilliant
                                        idea to develop and grow.
                                    </p>
