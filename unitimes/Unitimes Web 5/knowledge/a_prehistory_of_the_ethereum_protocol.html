                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although the ideas behind the current Ethereum
                                        protocol have largely been stable for two years, Ethereum did not emerge all at
                                        once, in its current conception and fully formed. Before the blockchain has
                                        launched, the protocol went through a number of significant evolutions and
                                        design decisions. The purpose of this article will be to go through the various
                                        evolutions that the protocol went through from start to launch; the countless
                                        work that was done on the implementations of the protocol such as Geth,
                                        cppethereum, pyethereum, and EthereumJ, as well as the history of applications
                                        and businesses in the Ethereum ecosystem, is deliberately out of scope.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also out of scope is the history of Casper and
                                        sharding research. While we can certainly make more blog posts talking about all
                                        of the various ideas Vlad, Gavin, myself and others came up with, and discarded,
                                        including “proof of proof of work”, hub-and-spoke chains, “<a

                                            iterations of Casper</a>, as well as Vlad’s rapidly evolving thoughts on
                                        reasoning about incentives of actors in consensus protocols and properties
                                        thereof, this would also be far too complex a story to go through in one post,
                                        so we will leave it out for now.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us first begin with the very earliest
                                        version of what would eventually become Ethereum, back when it was not even
                                        called Ethereum. When I was visiting Israel in October 2013, I spent quite a bit
                                        of time with the Mastercoin team, and even suggested a few features for them.
                                        After spending a couple of times thinking about what they were doing, I sent the
                                        team a proposal to make their protocol more generalized and support more types
                                        of contracts without adding an equally large and complex set of features:
                                        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html</a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><img width="100%"
                                                                               src="../images/knowledge/ultimatescripting.png"
                                                                               alt=""></p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notice that this is very far from the later
                                        and more expansive vision of Ethereum: it specialized purely in what Mastercoin
                                        was trying to specialize in already, namely two-party contracts where parties A
                                        and B would both put in money, and then they would later get money out according
                                        to some formula specified in the contract (eg. a bet would say “if X happens
                                        then give all the money to A, otherwise give all the money to B”). The scripting
                                        language was not Turing-complete.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Mastercoin team was impressed, but they
                                        were not interested in dropping everything they were doing to go in this
                                        direction, which I was increasingly convinced is the correct choice. So here
                                        comes version 2, circa December:

                                        rearchitecting, largely a result of a long walk through San Francisco I took in
                                        November once I realized that smart contracts could potentially be fully
                                        generalized. Instead of the scripting language being simply a way of describing
                                        the terms of relations between two parties, contracts were themselves
                                        fully-fledged accounts, and had the ability to hold, send and receive assets,
                                        and even maintain a permanent storage (back then, the permanent storage was
                                        called “memory”, and the only temporary “memory” was the 256 registers). The
                                        language switched from being a stack-based machine to being a register-based one
                                        on my own volition; I had little argument for this other than that it seemed
                                        more sophisticated.</p>

                                        every single computational step, the balance of the contract that a transaction
                                        was calling would drop a little bit, and if the contract ran out of money
                                        execution would halt. Note that this “receiver pays” mechanism meant that the
                                        contract itself had to require the sender to pay the contract a fee, and
                                        immediately exit if this fee is not present; the protocol allocated an allowance
                                        of 16 free execution steps to allow contracts to reject non-fee-paying

                                        Gavin’s initial contributions were two-fold. First, you might notice that the
                                        contract calling model in the initial design was an asynchronous one: although
                                        contract A could create an “internal transaction” to contract B (“internal
                                        transaction” is Etherscan’s lingo; initially they were just called
                                        “transactions” and then later “message calls” or “calls”), the internal
                                        transaction’s execution would not start until the execution of the first
                                        transaction completely finished. This meant that transactions could not use
                                        internal transactions as a way of getting information from other contracts; the
                                        only way to do that was the EXTRO opcode (kind of like an SLOAD that you could
                                        use to read other contracts’ storage), and this too was later removed with the
                                        support of Gavin and others.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When implementing my initial spec, Gavin
                                        naturally implemented internal transactions synchronously without even realizing
                                        that the intent was different - that is to say, in Gavin’s implementation, when
                                        a contract calls another contract, the internal transaction gets executed
                                        immediately, and once that execution finishes, the VM returns back to the
                                        contract that created the internal transaction and proceeds to the next opcode.
                                        This approach seemed to both of us to be superior, so we decided to make it part
                                        of the spec.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, a discussion between him and myself
                                        (during a walk in San Francisco, so the exact details will be forever lost to
                                        the winds of history and possibly a copy or two in the deep archives of the NSA)
                                        led to a re-factoring of the transaction fee model, moving away from the
                                        “contract pays” approach to a “sender pays” approach, and also switching to the
                                        “gas” architecture. Instead of each individual transaction step immediately
                                        taking away a bit of ether, the transaction sender pays for and is allocated
                                        some “gas” (roughly, a counter of computational steps), and computational steps
                                        drew from this allowance of gas. If a transaction runs out of gas, the gas would
                                        still be forfeit, but the entire execution would be reverted; this seemed like
                                        the safest thing to do, as it removed an entire class of “partial execution”
                                        attacks that contracts previously had to worry about. When a transaction
                                        execution finishes, the fee for any unused gas is refunded.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gavin can also be largely credited for the
                                        subtle change in vision from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building
                                        programmable money, with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets
                                        and transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing
                                        platform. This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology, and
                                        later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on the “Web 3”
                                        ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite of decentralized
                                        technologies, the other two being Whisper and Swarm.</p>

                                        limited to 32 bytes; the other alternative being considered, unlimited-size

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dagger was named after the “directed acyclic
                                        graph” (DAG), the mathematical structure that is used in the algorithm. The idea
                                        is that every N blocks, a new DAG would be pseudorandomly generated from a seed,
                                        and the bottom layer of the DAG would be a collection of nodes that takes
                                        several gigabytes to store. However, generating any individual value in the DAG
                                        would require calculating only a few thousand entries. A “Dagger computation”
                                        involved getting some number of values in random positions in this bottom-level
                                        dataset and hashing them together. This meant that there was a fast way to make
                                        a Dagger calculation - already having the data in memory, and a slow, but not
                                        memory intensive way - regenerating each value from the DAG that you need to get
                                        from scratch.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The intention of this algorithm was to have
                                        the same “memory-hardness” properties as algorithms that were popular at the
                                        time, like Scrypt, but still be light-client friendly. Miners would use the fast
                                        way, and so their mining would be constrained by memory bandwidth (the theory is
                                        that consumer-grade RAM is already very heavily optimized, and so it would be
                                        hard to further optimize it with ASICs), but light clients could use the
                                        memory-free but slower version for verification. The fast way might take a few
                                        microseconds and the slow but memory-free way a few milliseconds, so it would
                                        still be very viable for light clients.</p>

                                        times over the course of Ethereum development. The next idea that we went
                                        through is “adaptive proof of work”; here, the proof of work would involve
                                        executing randomly selected Ethereum contracts, and there is a clever reason why
                                        this is expected to be ASIC-resistant: if an ASIC was developed, competing
                                        miners would have the incentive to create and publish many contracts that that
                                        ASIC was not good at executing. There is no such thing as an ASIC for general
                                        computation, the story goes, as that is just a CPU, so we could instead use this
                                        kind of adversarial incentive mechanism to make a proof of work that essentially
                                        was executing general computation.</p>

                                        simple contracts that they can create specialized hardware for, and rapidly
                                        overtake the main chain. So… back to the drawing board.</p>

                                            by Matthew Wampler-Doty</a> and others. The idea here was also to simulate
                                        general-purpose computation inside a mining algorithm, this time by executing
                                        randomly generated circuits. There’s no hard proof that something based on these
                                        principles could not work, but the computer hardware experts that we reached out
                                        to in 2014 tended to be fairly pessimistic on it. Matthew Wampler-Doty himself
                                        suggested a proof of work based on SAT solving, but this too was ultimately
                                        rejected.</p>

                                        called “Dagger Hashimoto”. “Dashimoto”, as it was sometimes called in short,
                                        borrowed many ideas from <a

                                        bound proof of work”, where the dominant limiting factor in mining speed was not
                                        hashes per second, but rather megabytes per second of RAM access. However, it
                                        combined this with Dagger’s notion of light-client-friendly DAG-generated
                                        datasets. After many rounds of tweaking by myself, Matthew, Tim and others, the

                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In September, Gavin and I planned out the next
                                        two major changes to the protocol design. First, alongside the state tree and
                                        transaction tree, every block would also contain a “receipt tree”. The receipt
                                        tree would include hashes of the logs created by a transaction, along with
                                        intermediate state roots. Logs would allow transactions to create “outputs” that
                                        are saved in the blockchain, and are accessible to light clients, but that are
                                        not accessible to future state calculations. This could be used to allow
                                        decentralized applications to easily query for events, such as token transfers,
                                        purchases, exchange orders being created and filled, auctions being started, and
                                        so forth.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were other ideas that were considered,
                                        like making a Merkle tree out of the entire execution trace of a transaction to
                                        allow anything to be proven; logs were chosen because they were a compromise
                                        between simplicity and completeness.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second was the idea of “precompiles”,
                                        solving the problem of allowing complex cryptographic computations to be usable
                                        in the EVM without having to deal with EVM overhead. We had also gone through
                                        many more ambitious ideas about “<a
                                                href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/27/state-ethereum-august-edition/">native
                                            contracts</a>”, where if miners have an optimized implementation of some
                                        contracts they could “vote” the gasprice of those contracts down, so contracts
                                        that most miners could execute much more quickly would naturally have a lower
                                        gas price; however, all of these ideas were rejected because we could not come
                                        up with a cryptoeconomically safe way to implement such a thing. An attacker
                                        could always create a contract which executes some trapdoored cryptographic
                                        operation, distribute the trapdoor to themselves and their friends to allow them
                                        to execute this contract much faster, then vote the gasprice down and use this
                                        to DoS the network. Instead we opted for the much less ambitious approach of
                                        having a smaller number of precompiles that are simply specified in the
                                        protocol, for common operations such as hashes and signature schemes.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gavin was also a key initial voice in
                                        developing the idea of “<a

                                            abstraction</a>” - moving as many parts of the protocol such as ether
                                        balances, transaction signing algorithms, nonces, etc into the protocol itself
                                        as contracts, with a theoretical final goal of reaching a situation where the
                                        entire ethereum protocol could be described as making a function call into a
                                        virtual machine that has some pre-initialized state. There was not enough time
                                        for these ideas to get into the initial Frontier release, but the principles are
                                        expected to start slowly getting integrated through some of the Constantinople
                                        changes, the Casper contract and the sharding specification.</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was all implemented in PoC7; after PoC7,
                                        the protocol did not really change much, with the exception of minor, though in
                                        some cases important, details that would come out through security audits…</p>
                                    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In early 2015, came the pre-launch security
                                        audits organized by Jutta Steiner and others, which included both software code
                                        audits and academic audits. The software audits were primarily on the C++ and Go
                                        implementations, which were led by Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke, respectively,
                                        though there was also a smaller audit on my pyethereum implementation. Of the
                                        two academic audits, one was performed by Ittay Eyal (of “selfish mining” fame),
                                        and the other by Andrew Miller and others from Least Authority. The Eyal audit
                                        led to a minor protocol change: the total difficulty of a chain would not

                                        Another significant thing that we discussed was the gas limit voting mechanism.
                                        At the time, we were already concerned by perceived lack of progress in the
                                        bitcoin block size debate, and wanted to have a more flexible design in Ethereum
                                        that could adjust over time as needed. But the challenge is: what is the optimal
                                        limit? My initial thought had been to make a dynamic limit, targeting 1.5 times
                                        the long-term exponential moving average of the actual gas usage, so that in the
                                        long run on average blocks would be 2/3 full. However, Andrew showed that this
                                        was exploitable in some ways - specifically, miners who wanted to raise the
                                        limit would simply include transactions in their own blocks that consume a very
                                        large amount of gas, but take very little time to process, and thereby always
                                        create full blocks at no cost to themselves. The security model was thus, at
                                        least in the upward direction, equivalent to simply having miners vote on the
                                        gas limit.</p>

                                        strategy that was less likely to break, and so Andrew’s recommended solution was
                                        to simply have miners vote on the gas limit explicitly, and have the default
                                        strategy for voting be the 1.5x EMA rule. The reasoning was that we were still
                                        very far from knowing the right approach for setting maximum gas limits, and the
                                        risk of any specific approach failing seemed greater than the risk of miners
                                        abusing their voting power. Hence, we might as well simply let miners vote on
                                        the gas limit, and accept the risk that the limit will go too high or too low,
                                        in exchange for the benefit of flexibility, and the ability for miners to work
                                        together to very quickly adjust the limit upwards or downwards as needed.</p>

                                        myself, PoC9 was launched in March, and was intended to be the final proof of
                                        concept release. A testnet, Olympic, ran for four months, using the protocol
                                        that was intended to be used in the livenet, and Ethereum’s long-term plan was
                                        established. Vinay Gupta wrote a blog post, “<a

                                            Ethereum Launch Process</a>”, that described the four expected stages of
                                        Ethereum livenet development, and gave them their current names: Frontier,
                                        Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.</p>

                                        months, many bugs were found in the various implementations, consensus failures
                                        happened, among other issues, but around June the network noticeably stabilized.
                                        In July a decision was made to make a code-freeze, followed by a release, and on
                                        July 30 the release took place.</p>
