                        Toronto has a public transit system, complete with underground subways, rapid transit (RT),
                        streetcars and buses. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operates this system and publishes a
                        free transit map that is available from any subway station, at ISS in POD-61, or click <a

                        <br><br>The cash fare for an adult is $3.25 <a

                        You can also purchase
                        prepaid fares such as tokens, tickets or monthly passes that are slightly cheaper than the cash
                        fare. If paying by cash, exact change is required on buses and streetcars.

                    <p>
                        There are several cab or taxi companies operating in Toronto. Cab fare begins at $4.00 (or
                        higher) as soon as you step into it. Tipping (7% to 10%) is a customary practice but not
                        mandatory. Cash is an acceptable method of payment and sometimes credit card.

                    <p>
                        Use caution whenever driving downtown due to the volume of cars, pedestrians and road
                        restrictions. Purchase of a road map is advisable. Driving licenses are required and there are
                        free Driving Regulations books available from most Ministry of Transportation offices (consult
                        blue section of white pages for phone numbers).
                        <br><br>If you have a valid <a
                            href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/driving.html">Driver's
                        License</a> and wish to rent a car, there are many car rental
                        businesses providing that service in Toronto. For a typical day rental, the rate is generally
                        $50 a day (including insurance and sometimes mileage). The absolute minimum car rental age is 21
                        years old and all businesses require a credit card as a deposit.
                        <br><br>Parking in a public parking lot is expensive in downtown Toronto. Both Jarvis Street and
                        Church
                        Street have coin meter parking, however, it only allows a maximum of 2 hours on the time meter.
                        It is important to note that on the vast majority of main streets downtown, parking and stopping
                        is prohibited during morning and evening rush hours. Remove your car during those hours or it
                        will be towed-away and you will be fined. Please check with street signs before parking.
